# e2compr

This was a project I did for a 6.8xx course at MIT in 1997.  The goal was to extend an existing
system in a significant way.  My partner and I chose to add transparent compression to the ext2
filesystem of Linux.

This was against the Linux 2.0 kernel.

## Status

Mostly I'm posting this as an archive.

IIRC it worked back in the day, and it was better in some ways than the other ext2 compression
options available at the time.  But it was just a term project, never really tested or reviewed.

Might be fun to toy with though, to placate those retro-kernel-hacking urges.
