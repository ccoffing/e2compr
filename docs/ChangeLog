1998-7-5  Charles Coffing  <kiowa@mit.edu>
	* moved -1 flag to end of cluster
	* fixed deadlocks when retrying after failed [de]compression
	* fixed checksum computation
	* fixed off-by-one error in file.c when uncompressing to disk
	
1998-6-13  Charles Coffing  <kiowa@mit.edu>
	* Porting to 2.0.34
	
1998-1-10  Charles Coffing  <kiowa@mit.edu>
	* fixed compile errors when compression disabled
	
1998-1-4  Charles Coffing  <kiowa@mit.edu>
	* changed truncate back -- always uncompress otherwise hell breaks
	loose.  hm.
	* attempt to compress compressed cluster would generate an error
	due to the -1.  Reordered in ext2_compress_cluster() to avoid
	this.
	* added adler-32 checksum for full cluster uncompress
	
1998-1-3  Charles Coffing  <kiowa@mit.edu>
	* Changed migrator to repeatedly call SETCLUSTERBIT rather than
	ACTIVATE in an attempt to improve system responsiveness during
	compression.
	* truncate no longer uncompresses if we're truncating at a block
	boundary (eg, when doing an rm)
	* rearranged ext2_free_cluster_block to avoid an extra ext2_bmap()
	call.  This may speed freeing blocks after compression.
	
1998-1-1  Charles Coffing  <kiowa@mit.edu>
	* Removed *key*() in compress.c since that choked on -1 blocks;
	replaced with simpler (slower?) method.  Rewrote
	ext2_free_cluster_blocks() to encapsulate the new method.
	
1997-12-31  Charles Coffing  <kiowa@mit.edu>
	* created "cattr" utility which can [un]compress individual
	clusters, view/change compression stats/flags/policy
	* EXT2_SET_POLICY was ORing without clearing old policy first
	* ext2_count_blocks() support for GETCOMPRRATIO was wrong
	
1997-12-30  Charles Coffing  <kiowa@mit.edu>
	* migrator bug: was calling GETCLUSTERBIT incorrectly
	* EXT2_COMPRBLK_FL wasn't set before compression, causing
	efficiency short-circuits to always say clusters were uncompressed
	* failed uncompression in ext2_put_compressed_inode could clear
	EXT2_COMPRBLK_FL when compressed blocks remained
	* removed redundant inode->u.ext2_i.i_policy; only using i_flags now
	* removed 512k limitation inherited from original e2compr
	* minor migrator updates: activate on 1, 2 instead of 0, 3 to minimize
	impact of failed EXT2_IOC_ACTIVATECOMPR
	* fixed discrepancy between e2compr grain size and EXT2_MIN_BLOCK_SIZE
	which resulted in bogus "invalid cluster len" message
	* reimplemented EXT2_IOC_CLRCLUSTERBIT and EXT2_IOC_SETCLUSTERBIT
	correctly in ioctl.c
	
1997-12-29  Charles Coffing  <kiowa@mit.edu>
	* fixed panic in load_block_bitmap due to freeing -1 block
	* minor migrator updates
	* greatly cleaned up e2compr debug messages
	* very simple tweak to allow fsck to run on partition with compressed
	files
	
1997-12-28  Charles Coffing  <kiowa@mit.edu>
	* fixed compression problem; now allocating memory based on config
	options

1997-12-27  Charles Coffing  <kiowa@mit.edu>
	* added level and memLevel options in fs/Config.in for gzip

1997-12-26  Charles Coffing  <kiowa@mit.edu>
	* Moved from 2.0.29 to 2.0.31 kernel
	* upgraded from zlib 0.93 to zlib 1.04
