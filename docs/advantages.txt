What's changed in autocompressing ext2 as compared to the original e2compr ?

- less intrusive on the inode's reserved bits
- transparent -- less headaches for the users; no more chattr.
- automated -- greater disk savings since nearly everything /may/ be compressed
- fast[er] -- "caches" recently used files uncompressed via uncompressed
  writeback
- handles large files without any extra overhead (used to be, e2compr would
  have to use an indirect bitmap for large files to determine compression state
  of clusters.)
- updated zlib (ver 1.04)
- updated kernel (2.0.34)

What's coming:

- fast[er] -- fewer memcpys to uncompress data  (RSN!)
